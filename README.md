This is a basic service module to implement microservices.

### Semantic Versioning & Commit Convention

This project follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).
We release patch versions for critical bugfixes, minor versions for new features or non-essential changes, and major
versions for any breaking changes.

This project also follows the [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) convention with some
additional customization:

#### Patch version changes

- refactor(optional_scope) - indicates a code refactoring.
- chore(deps): indicates some dependency has been added / updated and therefore a new release is needed.
- no-release: indicates the commit shouldn't trigger a release no matter what.


## Installation / Requirements

Nodejs >= 18

`npm i @experiments72/basic-service`

## Usage

### Service bootstrap

Create `BasicService` object and execute `run` method:

```
import { BasicService } from '../../src';

const pingService = new BasicService({port: 3000});

pingService.run(() => {
    console.log('server listen on port 3000');
});
```

### Create a controller

Create a class and use `Controller` and `API` decorators:

```
import { Controller, GET } from '../../src';

@Controller('ping')
export class PingController{

    @GET('/ping')
    public ping(): string{
        return 'pong';
    }

}
```
